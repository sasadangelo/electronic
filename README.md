# Electronics for All: Experiments and Circuits

Welcome to my GitHub repository dedicated to electronics experiments and projects. Here, I share a collection of electronic circuits, schematics, and detailed explanations for various levels of experience, from beginner to advanced. Each project includes my personal notes, observations, and tips for those who want to learn and deepen their understanding of electronics.

## Contents

This repository is divided into sections, each related to a different level of difficulty. You can explore the projects to find one that suits your skill level!

### 1. **Beginner Circuits**
In this section, you will find simple circuits perfect for those starting their journey into electronics. These projects focus on basic components like resistors, capacitors, LEDs, and simple connections.

#### Projects:
- **Simple LED**: a [simple circuit](docs/simple-led.md) to light up an LED with a resistor.
- **Simple Transformer**: a [simple circuit](docs/simple-transformer.md) to convert 230 V AC in 12 V AC.

### 2. **Intermediate Circuits**
This section contains more complex projects that involve additional components such as transistors, diodes, and sensors. These circuits are ideal for those who have a basic understanding and want to explore more challenging concepts.

#### Example Projects:
- **Transistor Amplifier**: A basic amplifier using a transistor to boost the signal.
